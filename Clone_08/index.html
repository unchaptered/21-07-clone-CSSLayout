            <p>The Clara Lionel Foundation (CLF) supports international education, health and emergency response programs, and engages in global advocacy initiatives with the goal of improving the quality of life for children. It was founded by Rihanna in honor of her grandparents.

              In 2017, our team worked on repositioning the non-profit as a strategic organization with roots and momentum. We proposed ways in which the CLF team could engage Rihanna's fan base, and redesigned their website to foster engagement and individual donations. Our studio team shot 360 video footage and photography with Roc Nation in Malawi. As Art Director, I led the rebrand of the CLF identity, proposing a dynamic logo and visual system that mirrored the youthful energy of the children supported by the foundation.</p>

            <p>Marriott Hotels repositioned themselves as an innovative travel company and launched a multi-channel campaign to communicate their new POV. We were tasked with creating a responsive website that could communicate their new brand positioning with content that can be repurposed and distributed throughout their digital ecosystem.

              We developed Marriott Magazine—a quarterly digital magazine catered to the modern traveler. We leveraged Marriott's brand recognition to book interviews with well-known people like Neil DeGrasse Tyson, and integrated quality video and photography assets by collaborating with existing partners TED and VSCO. The Wordpress-based solution was designed as a modular system of templates to maximize flexibility of content within their budget. Our team also found unique ways to integrate booking flows within each article type. As Art Director, I oversaw the design of the platform from concept to production.</p>
